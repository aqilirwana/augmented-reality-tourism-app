    attributeDetails: 'The Tangah Sawah Grand Mosque''s actual founding date is unknown.
      However, before it became a magnificent mosque, it was known as a jamik mosque,
      which was the centre of Islamic holiday celebrations for the inhabitants of
      Nagari. Kampung Tangah Sawah is the name given to the area surrounding this
      mosque. As the name implies, the village is nestled in the centre of rice fields.
      Tangah Sawah Village was previously part of the Nagari Kurai Limo Jorong region,
      which evolved into the modern Bukittinggi area. Tangah Sawah Village has grown
      in population as a result of the community''s economic development. There are
      no rice fields left. In truth,  Not only is the area surrounding the mosque
      becoming more congested, but its appearance has also altered. The mosque appears
      to have two domes: one huge in the centre and one on either side of the mihrab.
      Unfortunately, there is no information on when this adjustment occurred. Major
      changes occurred in 1976. This mosque had a comprehensive renovation before
      becoming what it is now. The structure was enlarged and updated to two stories.
      Former Indonesian Vice President Mohammad Hatta laid the first stone for its
      construction on August 13, 1976.The Tangah Sawah Grand Mosque holds significant
      value for the Bukittinggi community. Because of its central location, this
      mosque is never empty.  This is assisted by the mosque''s big parking area,
      which can handle a significant number of vehicles. Indeed, the city transport
      terminus in front of the mosque can be vacated for parking if it is not accommodated.'
