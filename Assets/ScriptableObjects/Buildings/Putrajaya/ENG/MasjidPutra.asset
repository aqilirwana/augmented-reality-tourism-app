    attributeDetails: "Named after Malaysia\u2019s first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul
      Rahman Putra Al Haj, Masjid Putra with its trademark pink domes is one of Putrajaya\u2019s
      popular landmarks. Surrounded by Putrajaya Lake and facing Putra Square \u2013
      two other popular attractions in Putrajaya \u2013 the mosque was built between
      1997 and 1999. The mosque is modelled after the Persian Islamic architecture
      of the Safavid period, with some design elements borrowed from other mosques
      around the world. Its basement wall is reminiscent of the one in Morocco\u2019s
      King Hassan Mosque, while its 116-metre minaret resembles that of the Sheikh
      Omar Mosque in Baghdad, Iraq. Masjid Putra consists of three main areas \u2013
      a 12-column main prayer hall, a landscaped courtyard named The Sahn and an
      area housing a religious learning centre and function rooms. The mosque can
      accommodate 15,000 worshippers at a time. The Masjid Putra, commonly known
      as the \u2018Pink Mosque\u2019 on account of its rose-tinted granite structure
      and striking pink domes, is undoubtedly the most iconic structure in Putrajaya
      besides the green onion- domed building of Perdana Putra, the Prime Minister\u2019s
      Office. Situated on the edge of a man-made lake, the mosque is amongst a number
      of modern architectural marvels in the \u2018Garden Intelligent City\u2019
      of Putrajaya. The mosque\u2019s monumental dome, clad in glazed pink tiles,
      pointed clerestory windows and soaring geometrical minaret is a culmination
      of various Islamic architectural influences. In contrast to the Masjid Negara
      in Kuala Lumpur, Masjid Putra exudes clear expressions of multiple Islamic
      architectural elements originating from the Middle-East. The imposing nature
      of the mosque is expressed through three main elements, which are the grand
      mosque\u2019s structure, courtyard or sahn and the 116 metres (380 feet) minaret.
      Despite enjoying its strong and imposing image, sahn has been used as a transition
      space between the outer world and religious realms. This has also been demarcated
      by a monumental arched portal. The Masjid Putra is sited fronting the large
      Putra Square, and the man-made lagoon is connected from the public square\u2019s
      level of the promenade in a sloping nature, with waterfront landscaped gardens
      beautifying the area. It is linked to the Putrajaya Boulevard and commercial
      district of Precinct 2 through the Persian-inspired Putra Bridge. At the promenade,
      the Souq Putrajaya with various eatery places and shops are provided, with
      a basement level entrance of the mosque. In addition to the main pink dome,
      eight smaller pink domes with similar patterns are distributed across the cupolas
      of the main prayer hall building. They flank the main dome which sits on an
      octagonal tier above a flat roof. The square layout of the main prayer hall
      is richly crafted with intricate decorations in the Islamic tradition. Every
      single angle and corner is embellished with floral and decorative motifs. Twelve
      columns span the space, forming pointed arches across the hall. The prayer
      hall is surrounded by a glass wall that provides an indirect source of natural
      lighting to illuminate the interior spaces. The front qibla wall is finished
      by floral plaster motifs on the each side of the mihrab, and diamond-shaped
      windows. The mihrab, placed in the centre of the three-segmented qibla wall,
      comprises a square frame supported by pilasters before the niche, which sits
      under a smaller arch. The marble frame is adorned with calligraphic inscriptions.
      The stairs of the elevated wooden minbar lead to a pulpit platform topped with
      a dome embellished in gold;"
