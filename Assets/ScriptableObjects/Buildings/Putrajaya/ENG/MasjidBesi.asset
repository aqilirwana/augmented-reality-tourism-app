    attributeDetails: "Masjid Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin was named after the country\u2019s
      13th Yang Di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia) at that time, Al-Wathiqu Billah
      Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin Ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Mahmud Al-Muktafi Billah Shah.
      Able to fit up to 20,000 worshippers at a time, it began construction in April
      2004 and was completed in August 2009. The mosque was built out of 6000 tonnes
      of reinforced stainless steel which makes up 70 percent of its structure, earning
      it the moniker, Steel Mosque. A walkway named Qibla Walk connects the mosque
      to the nearby Putrajaya Corporation Complex. Employing a light, airy and transparent
      design concept, the mosque relies on natural ventilation and an air-cooling
      technology called \u2018Gas District Cooling\u2019 to ensure that the air within
      the building stays cool even without the use of fans or air conditioners. Lattice
      screens made from stainless steel surround its main prayer hall in place of
      walls, allowing free flow of air. Thirteen-metre glass panels imported from
      Germany, on which verses from the Holy Qur\u2019an are engraved, adorn its
      interior, giving the impression of \u2018floating verses\u2019. Unlike most
      mosques in the country, Masjid Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin didn\u2019t borrow
      design ideas from the Middle East, but instead adopts a combination of Chinese
      and German architectural styles. And unlike most mosques, it doesn\u2019t come
      with a minaret (Islamic Tourism Centre, 2013). The Steel Mosque is situated
      in a beautiful lakeside setting close to the offices of the Malaysian government
      administrative buildings in Putrajaya. As the second principal mosque after
      the Putra Mosque, located near the Prime Minister\u2019s office, this mosque
      has become a significant landmark and tourist attraction in Putrajaya. The
      mosque has been rewarded with several awards, namely the Malaysian Institute
      of Architects (PAM) Steel Awards 2011 for Interior Category and the Schott
      Architectural Glass Award 2006.   The mosque\u2019s most peculiar feature is
      the \u2018iron\u2019 materials (steel and metal), which is employed extensively
      in its design: 70 per cent of the building materials are stainless steel. Its
      striking mesh facilitates daylight and natural ventilation into the mosque,
      thus eliminating the need for any artificial lighting or mechanical ventilation.
      The mesh element, known as mashrabiya screen, gives the mosque\u2019s exterior
      a \u2018filigree\u2019 appearance. The deep overhang of the main building supported
      by tall arched steel columns feature the design that reflects elements of traditional
      Islamic architecture. Pointed arches used at the side aisles and naves of the
      prayer hall interior have resulted in a very high and lofty ceiling.   The
      vastness of the space contributes to the sense of humility and modesty to the
      worshippers, thus creating a tranquil, calm, ethereal space for praying.The
      passive cooling concept is also attributed to the materials used in the mosque\u2019s
      construction, including the marble flooring and the steel mesh that is used
      to cool the perimeter wall covering of its facade. The mesh \u2018screens\u2019
      act as a shelter to protect the interior from the rain and direct sunlight.
      The high-volume space of the hall not only gives a monumental grandeur, but
      also enhances both the natural lighting and ventilation. The qibla wall, directly
      facing the lake is opened to the elements. It is indicated by a huge square
      portal. The wall comprises entirely of large panels of anti-reflective glass
      inscribed with Nasakh calligraphy. The mihrab is formed by a small, tiered,
      square portal finished with white glazed tiles. The seamlessly plain form combines
      perfectly with an elevated marble minbar to its right. The minbar is connected
      by a flight of stairs placed in front to its right and leads upwards to the
      domed pulpit platform."
